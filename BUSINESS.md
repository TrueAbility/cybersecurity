## Support

## Data

We attempt to collect as little data as necessary to operate our business; however, we do collect and use aggregate metadata to understand our service usage, improve the quality of future services and provide reporting internally and to the community.

## Data Classification

We classify data into primarily two classes:

Sensitive Data
---
* Personal Identification Information (PII): This includes any data that can be used to identify individuals, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and date of births. Given the nature of your certification services, you might handle information related to professional qualifications or certifications that also falls into this category.
* Financial Information: Credit card details, bank account numbers, and other financial data of your clients or users.
Confidential Business Information: This may encompass proprietary methods, assessment criteria, internal processes, or any data that gives your business a competitive edge.
* User Authentication Data: Passwords, security tokens, or any other information used for accessing your services.
Compliance-related Data: Any data that is subject to regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, etc., especially if your certification involves sectors like healthcare or finance.

Routine Data
---
* General Correspondence: Basic communication with clients or users that doesnâ€™t contain sensitive information.
* Marketing Data: Non-personalized data used for marketing purposes, such as aggregated user statistics or general market research.
* Publicly Available Information: Information that is already public knowledge and not confidential, such as publicly posted testimonials or general industry news.
* Operational Data: Non-sensitive data related to the day-to-day operation of your service, such as service usage metrics, website analytics, and performance data.
